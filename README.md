# Eat-Da-Burger
# My-Amazon


## Description
This application demonstrates an application with front end implemented with HTML/CSS and the backend executed with Node.js and Express. The HTML template is done with the assistance of Handlebars.

The user has the ability to create a burger that will be added to the menu. In addition to adding the burger to the menus, this also adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database. The initial burger entry is an available option on the menu and placed on the left side of the screen. The user may then eat any burger by clicking on it thus moving it to the devoured column and its status is updated accordingly in the database.


## MySql Database 
To run this application, you need to install the MySQL database on your device. If you do not have this application installed, view the package.json page to install the version you need for your operating system. Once MySQL is intalled, you can create the Eat Da Burger database and the burger table with the SQL code found in schema.sql. Run this code inside your MySQL Workbench to populate the database, then you will be ready to proceed with running the Eat Da Burger interface.
